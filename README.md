# Autonomous and Adaptive Systems course notes

This repository contains my notes for the University of Bologna's [Autonomous and Adaptive Systems](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2020/454632) course, held by prof. [Mirco Musolesi](https://www.mircomusolesi.org/). They are based on prof. Musolesi's slides, available [here](https://www.mircomusolesi.org/courses/AAS20-21/AAS20-21-main) and on Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto’s “Reinforcement Learning, An  Introduction”  book, available [here](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf).

The latest build of the notes will always be available at the following address: https://github.com/AlessandroPomponio/aas-course-notes/blob/main/main.pdf, while a "hand-compiled" version may be made available once the course has ended.
